The password automatically generates a password_hash that is used to check the password when loggin in. Also included in the user database is the relationship of being a buyer. Once a customer makes a purchase, their user id is tied to that listing and they're now marked as the buyer of the listing. This allows the user to view all past purchases. Create Account To create an account, a user can select the sign up button on the Login page. This wil redirect the user to the sign up page. Once on the page, the user must input a username and password. The password digits will show up as dots for privacy. Once both text entries are filled, the user submits the register button. The system then adds the username and password into the database for users. Delete Account Description of deleting an account Login Navigate to /login page by clicking the Login button in the top Navbar.
