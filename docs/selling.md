# Selling

All items on the site are created, viewed and bought by users. Each listing can be viewed by anyone who is logged in. 

## Creating Listings

Each listing consists of a title, description, price, and image. The listings are kept in a database which also includes a boolean for if it's available for immediate purchase and auction bidding. Users create a listing by navigating to the new listing page (through the navbar). They must be logged in to create a listing. Once logged in and on the page, users can input the title, image**** and description of the listing. They must then choose if the listing is for immediate purchase or for auction. They assign this by selecting the boolean boxes on the page.

### For Purchase

If the user chooses that the listing is available for immediate purchase, a text entry box appears, requesting that a price be entered. The user then inputs the price into the box. This is the final submission, so the user can click 'Create listing.' The system then gives the listing a listing id and adds it the listing database. 

### For Auction
