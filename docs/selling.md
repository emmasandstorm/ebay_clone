# Selling

All items on the site are created, viewed and bought by users. Each listing can be viewed by anyone who is logged in.

## Creating Listings

Each listing consists of a title, description, and image. Users create a listing by navigating to the new listing page (through the navbar). They must be logged in to create a listing. Once logged in and on the page, users can input the title, image, and description of the listing. They must then choose if the listing is for immediate purchase or for auction. They assign this by selecting the boolean boxes on the page. Items listed for auction must have an end date, and items listed for instant purchase must have a price.

Note, to create a listing users must upload an image from their own system, just as a .jpg of a chessboard they wish to sell.

### For Purchase

If the user chooses that the listing is available for immediate purchase, a text entry box appears, requesting that a price be entered. The user then inputs the price into the box. This is the final submission, so the user can click 'Create listing.' The system then gives the listing a listing id and adds it the listing database.

### For Auction

Items listed for auction open for bidding as soon as the listing is created. Bidding continues until midnight UTC on the end date (as in before dawn) supplied by the seller. See Auctions for more information.
