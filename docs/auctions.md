# Auctions

Sellers may enable auctions on their listing at the time of listing creation. Auctions begin when the listing is created and end at midnight on the date the seller selects. While the auction is live, it will accept bids from all logged in users.

## Finding Listings

Listings are visible on the home page and may be searched by title and description.

## Bidding

The process of bidding is straightforward. Simply navigate to a listing that is open for auction. On the page, above the listing image, you will see a text box next to a Place Bid button. Simply fill in your bid (in whole dollars only) and press Place Bid. If your bid beats the current highest bid, your bid will be displayed. Be careful, as you can always outbid yourself! If you have the highest bid when the auction ends, a prompt will appear when you navigate to the listing allowing you to put the listing in your cart. The price will be the same as your highest bid.

## Checkout

Cart, checkout, and purchased listings are the same as [buying](buying.md).
